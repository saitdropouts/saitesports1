        TIP #1: LEARN THE BASICS OF THE MAP
          the league of legends map is fairly different than the other games mentioned on our website.
          league of legends is a multiplayer online battle arena game. the layout is a lot different from shooters.
          the map includes things such as turrets. inhibitors, the shop, 3 lanes, and more.  <br>
						
        TIP #2: CHAMPIONS
          in league of legends there are many different type of champs that specialize in different things.
          before playing a game it's a good idea to find out the differences between all of them
          and to choose one that suits your gamestyle. there are different champ pools that speciailize in specific
          things, and play in specific lanes <br>
					
        TIP #3: TEAMWORK!!
          league of legends runs off teamwork, it's not really a game that you're able to do ALL the work alone,
          trust your teammates, it'll come in handy! :) <br>
