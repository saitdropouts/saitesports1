					<h1 class="article-title">Valorant Beginners Guide</h1>
						<p class="article-text">
					TIP #1: BEFORE YOU PLAY, CONFIGURE SETTINGS TO OPTIMIZE GAMING EXPERIENCE 
						before playing any video game, you should always view all the settings to suit YOU before playing.
						you can also always start up the tutorial mode and configure settings there so things like your 
						sensitivity, sounds, and visual aspects are all comfortable to you. <br>
						
					TIP #2: READ ALL THE AGENTS ABILITIES TO FIND OUT WHO SUITS YOU THE MOST
						in valorant there are many different type of agents that specialize in different things.
						before playing a game it's a good idea to find out the differences between all of them
						and to choose one that suits your gamestyle. <br>
					
					TIP #3: LEARN HOW THE CREDIT SYSTEM WORKS
						the credit system in valorant is a very important aspect to the game, without knowing how 
						it works you won't have money to buy weapons in game! having knowledge on the credit system will
						give you an edge on your opponents, allowing you to have better guns when they don't.
						know the difference between save rounds, full buy rounds, force buy rounds, and half buy rounds. <br>
					TIP #4:	DON'T RUN AND SHOOT	
						valorant is a tactical shooter so shooting while running decreases your accuracy immensely. if you stand 
						still while shooting you'll have nearly 100% accuracy (not accounting for recoil), this will make it 
						easier for you to get kills <br>
	
					TIP #5: WALK!!!!
						everytime you run in valorant you make a lot of noise which reveals your location, depending on your
						keybinds, holding the walk button will keep your location concealed which makes it easier to sneak up on 
						opponents. mastering the timing of sprinting and walking will improve your gameplay immensely
