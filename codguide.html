						<p class="article-text">
					TIP #1: BEFORE YOU PLAY, CONFIGURE SETTINGS TO OPTIMIZE GAMING EXPERIENCE 
						before playing any video game, you should always view all the settings to suit YOU before playing.
						you can also always start up the tutorial mode and configure settings there so things like your 
						sensitivity, sounds, and visual aspects are all comfortable to you. <br>
						
          TIP #2: USE YOUR UTILITY!!
            in call of duty, you're always equipped with two types of utility, one being tactical utility, another
            being lethal utility. figuring out good combinations of using specific utility will give you an edge
            on your competition. <br>
					
          TIP #3: LEARN THE MAPS AND WEAPONS
            every map in call of duty is different, figuring out that every map has different routes and sections
            is very important. different maps require different playstyles and learning them can elevate your 
            gameplay. some maps are played better with certain weapons as well, learning how to use a wide range 
            of weapons will help you improve in the game. <br>
